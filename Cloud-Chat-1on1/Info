Instructions for Cloud_Chat_1on1

This is for 1-1 conversations
Both users must go into their router and port forward a port to use (default is 4444). To make it so only one person needs to do this, use Cloud_Group_Chat instead
Both users download the client .exe file (nothing installs, just run the .exe file)
There will be a popup blocking the file, click to run it anyway. I built this by hand, trust me there's no viruses here.
Enter Eachother's Local IP's and click Update button
Enter Eachother's forwarded port and click Update button
Both clients enter the same password
Click connect
